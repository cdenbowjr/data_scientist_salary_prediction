Other programs include an immersive English language learning product for children in China; ReadingIQ, a world-class digital library with thousands of curated books; and a groundbreaking adaptive learning system that personalizes math instruction for every learner.

We are committed to helping all children succeed. Through our Education Access Initiatives, we make ABCmouse available at no cost to millions of children through schools, libraries, Head Start programs, and community centers—including public housing authorities and after-school programs.

As we expand our global reach and increase the educational impact of our programs, we’re looking for passionate, ambitious, and collaborative leaders to become a part of our growing team!

Summary:
Age of Learning is looking for a junior data scientist to work on the English Language Learning (ELL) team creating next-generation adaptive learning technologies.
In this position, you will work with existing applications that have high quality and large-scale behavioral data sets, helping product managers and curriculum specialists understand what the data means, and helping to design adaptive strategies which will personalize educational content in production. While you may not create brand new machine learning methods or algorithms, you will spend a fair amount of your time both choosing/fitting models and helping deployment and production teams figure out replacement and degradation strategies (e.g. working on taking machine learning straight to production).
Note that this is an “embedded” and “on-site” position—you will be an integral part of the game team, reporting to the game production leaders, while also interfacing with the central analytics team, and you will be required to be located at the corporate campus.
Responsibilities:
Work closely with product management to understand what’s going on in production by analyzing behavioral data. Suggest additional data to collect in new releases to enhance understanding.
Maintain and extend our telemetry specifications and work with both engineering and QA to make sure they’re implemented correctly. On an on-demand basis, this will involve reviewing QA plans and helping QA engineers understand data semantics.
Work with senior data scientists and management to design and build new models both to internal servers and for production use.
Perform ad-hoc analysis and model fitting as we extend the range of in-production adaptive behavior.
Help to build a reusable library of data visualizations which enable quick reproduction and reuse of analytical tools on other games and products.
Work on our data validation and integrity frameworks (especially in the first three months, while learning our data models and representations).
Act as an in-group data expert and make recommendations regarding standards for data naming and documentation.
Required Skills and Qualifications:
Degree in Computer Science or a related field (stats, econ, math, …)
A minimum of one year of experience in a data-science role.
Deep knowledge of the standard basket of machine learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, regularization techniques, cross-validation …) and proficiency with using machine learning algorithms in either Python or R.
Statistical fluency. You don’t need to have a degree in statistics, but you should understand why ANOVA is really just linear regression and be comfortable with figuring out which goodness-of-fit tests make sense in a particular scenario.
Experience writing SQL queries and data transforms against large-scale column-oriented databases (Vertica, Redshift, Snowflake, etcetera).
Strong desire to explain what you’ve learned from the data to the rest of the company, using visualization frameworks and (occasionally) Tableau dashboards.
A willingness to roll up your sleeves and do what it takes.
Desired Skills and Qualifications:
Knowledge of git and standard engineering processes (everything you do will be peer-reviewed and version-controlled in the company git)
Familiarity with adaptive educational technology and psychometric algorithms such as IRT (you will be creating and tuning algorithms for adaptive applications)
Experience with data quality frameworks and data validation /verification
Knowledge of Docker, and prior experience with using Docker containers (it’s how we deploy adaptive layers in production)
Mandarin-language skills

Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and sell them to buyers. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we seek to define the future of real estate.

Our team is tasked with absorbing up to billions of rows of data from various sources, organizing them, analyzing them, and visualizing them to help inform both short- and long-term decision-making.

You will tell stories that describe analytical results and insights in meetings of all sizes with diverse audiences.
You will provide thought leadership across a variety of technical and non-technical audiences to ensure that all levels of Zillow Group make decision with an analytical foundation.
Who you are
You will not shy away from complexity or uncertainty. You will develop a deep understanding of our mission, business models, and personas. We want you to use that intuition you've developed (both in business and real life) to find opportunities for growth and cultivate insights from our massive data sets. We're looking for a seasoned data scientist. We expect:
You have a Master's degree or higher in a quantitative field (e.g. science, engineering, economics, finance, statistics, or similar).
You have 2+ years of work experience involving quantitative data analysis and complex problem solving.
You have complete command of SQL, and either Python or R, along with some experience with visualization software like Tableau or libraries in Python/R.
You have extensive experience directly querying multi-terabyte-sized data sets (with Hive and Presto) including clickstream data (like Google Analytics), third party data (like Facebook) and raw data ingested from non-standard platforms.
You have practice with terminology, and measurement issues related to experimentation, along with a history of applying advanced analytical approaches to derive insights from the data.
You have strong written, verbal, and visual communication skills to concisely communicate in a way that provides context, offers insights, and minimizes misinterpretation.

Codecademy has helped over 45 million people from around the world upgrade their careers with engaging, accessible, and flexible education on programming and data skills. We provide over 200 hands-on interactive lessons ranging from Python to R to Javascript and everything in between. Our learners have gone on to start companies, new jobs, and new lives thanks to what they’ve learned with Codecademy, and we’re thrilled to be working to take that impact to the next level.

Codecademy was started in 2011 by two college students in a dorm room at Columbia that were frustrated by the huge gap between education and employment. A few years later, we are a rapidly growing, diverse team of 75+ in SoHo, NYC. We’ve raised over $40m in venture capital funding from top investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Naspers, Y Combinator, and more.
