The University of Western Australia (UWA) is ranked amongst the top 100 universities in the world and a member of the prestigious Australian Group of Eight research-intensive universities. With an enviable research track record, vibrant campus and working environments, supported by the freedom to ‘innovate and inspire’ there is no better time to join Western Australia’s top University.

About the team

ICRAR is a WA State funded high profile equal joint venture established in 2009 between Curtin University and The University of Western Australia (UWA). The Centre’s headquarters are located at UWA, with research nodes at both UWA and Curtin. ICRAR is one of the lead Australian organisations participating in the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Project. ICRAR has been further funded from 2019 to 2024 with $60 Million by the WA State Government and equal contribution from the Joint Venture Universities. ICRAR is one of the largest astronomy organisations in Australia.

ASTRO 3D is a $40m Research Centre of Excellence led by Professor Lisa Kewley. ASTRO 3D is funded over seven years by the Australian Research Council and supported by six collaborating Australian universities - ANU, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Western Australia and Curtin University. Other Australian partners in the Centre include CSIRO, the Australian Astronomical Observatory and National Computational Infrastructure. ASTRO 3D includes collaborations with world leading international institutions.

The ASTRO 3D mission is to produce a comprehensive picture of the evolution of matter, the chemical elements, and ionizing radiation in the Universe from shortly after the Big Bang to the present day. ASTRO 3D trains the next generation of scientific leaders and conducts nationwide education and public outreach programs.

To be considered for this role, you will demonstrate:

PhD in astronomy or related discipline
Expertise in area of astronomy relevant to the ASKAP WALLABY survey
Proficiency in verbal and written communication
Good publication record as evidenced by international refereed publications
Demonstrated ability to work effectively in distributed scientific collaborations

Data Science/ Electrical Engineering cross over
6-12 month Fixed term project - 130-140k Package

Overview

Supporting a consulting company across a client project for an Electricity provider.


At the moment there’s a disconnect between the electrical engineering team coming up with a solution and implementing that through the data science/coding team.


The data science people are running some machine learning projects but they lack the engineering knowledge to establish best practices instead of throwing large amounts of data into a program to try get an answer.


Whats the Job?


They need someone to be able to sit in the room with the engineers and understand what they’re discussing, then go off and work with the coders to find the right data sources and finish it off in a visualisation.


What are we after in our ideal candidate ?


You would need to have an electrical background or understanding of electricity, ideally worked in the energy industry. Also needs to be across coding and machine learning.


Would like someone who doesn’t need a high level of supervision, but can take a problem, go do some research and come up with a solution.


Currently having to micromanage a lot of coders as most of them aren’t seasoned data scientists.


You will need good communication skills


Level


Doesn’t have to be someone especially senior in experience if they have the right skillset.


Rates Circa $130k to $140k inc super for a senior Consultant

One of the world's largest peer-to-peer lenders. We have worked hard over the past four years to democratise lending with the aim of helping all Australians achieve more with less. We have made some great strides, reaching $500 million in lending, over 100 employees, growing at 100% year-on-year - and we're barely getting started. $1 billion in lending is firmly in our sights, and we are committed to making financial services more rewarding to every Australian.
We believe the financial system has become bloated and inefficient, and are using technology and data to give value - and power - back to the consumer.
The ambition is huge and the only way we can do this is by bringing the best people in the world to help us get there. That's where you come in.
Requirements
More about the role

Analytics sits at the heart of everything we do at RateSetter. Every decision across every team is and should be supported by data. As a result, we are looking to hire another Business Analyst:

You will be essential in applying your interpretations to the data and challenging the questions that are being asked to ensure that all data is being turned into actionable insights
You will be supporting with reporting for our commercial, finance and executive team
You will likely have an obsession with Automation, using your technical knowledge to automate as much of the reporting as you possibly can so you can jump into exciting value add tasks.
You will also have the opportunity to work with the technology team in advising on the creation of better infrastructure to extract data as we move closer and closer to real time performance.
If that wasn't enough. RateSetter is right at the heart of Open Banking reforms (most recently Comprehensive Credit Reporting).
As the financial system becomes more democratised, the more impact exceptional data analysts can have on the future of RateSetter and the lives of every day Australians.

You are likely a highly technical analyst, with great Excel/SQL (and Python) experience. You are also not satisfied with simply crunching reports requested from the team, but are always applying your commercial knowledge to provide genuine, actionable insights that can move the needle for the business.

To be great at this role you will have:
3+ years’ experience in providing insights which inform new product development and iteration
Experience with defining, implementing and analysing focused test and learn experiments
A grounding in mathematics / statistics and a bachelor's degree in a STEM area is preferred, but not required
Strong competency with SQL and Excel (a given) as well as extracting data using Python or R
Experience in data visualisation tools such as Tableau or Power BI
Flexibility and ability to build strong relationships, operate effectively within cross-functional teams, and influence business partners to lead changes
Superb organisation and attention to detail
Self-starter with an ability to work independently in a dynamic, fast changing environment and with a strong attention to details.
Benefits
What's life like at RateSetter?
Still wondering whether you'd enjoy being a part of our team? Here's a few great reasons:
We value openness and ideas more than anything else, it doesn't matter who you are in the business, we want your input
There are amazing opportunities here for people who are intelligent and hard-working. We're growing so fast right now we may not know exactly what the right role will be for you in two years time, but given our aims, we bet it would be something incredible.
(E.g our first software engineering hire joined as a developer and is now running a team of 20 amazing engineers)
A sincere purpose which every person here truly believes in
A great group of driven and intelligent colleagues
Amazing office location in the heart of the CBD
Great social events and a well stocked fridge on Friday
The RateSetter boat which we take out on Fridays (yes you heard me)
But ultimately, a fun environment where everyone believes in what they're doing and have boundless opportunities to progress.
Come take a look for yourself!
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."
