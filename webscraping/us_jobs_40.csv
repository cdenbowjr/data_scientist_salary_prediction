Computer Systems Researcher (Research Scientists),Research Scientist,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Maryland,"$99,172 - $152,352 a year",https://indeed.com//rc/clk?jk=468649e8a3be2834&fccid=e8f18ca6180ec8da&vjs=3,"The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.
The need to maintain our core Computer Science group is vital to provide the technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. The increased complexity of supporting NSA's mission requires world class researchers, programmers, and developers who operate in teams in areas such as software engineering, reverse engineering, information technology infrastructure, high performance computing, data science, architectures, computer security, and networking in order to design and develop advanced tools, techniques, and systems.
Description of Position
Research Scientists design, develop, deliver, and/or operate solutions to hard computer science problems within a scientific framework. The solutions may arise in the forms of forensics and attack attribution, protection of critical networks, active systems warnings and indicators, active penetration into target systems, knowledge discovery of passive and active systems, or other computer science mission support.
The Research Directorate is one of the NSA's six major directorates. Our mission is to conduct and operationalize research to help NSA improve the way it conducts its signals intelligence and cybersecurity missions (see www.nsa.gov/what-we-do for more information on these missions). Successful NSA researchers generalize a mission problem, conduct research to solve the problem, and work with other NSA organizations to apply the research to mission problems. Many NSA research activities have directly contributed to saving lives and protecting computer networks. In addition to working closely with our mission partners, our researchers collaborate regularly with the scientific community in academia, industry, and other government laboratories. We regularly publish papers on the unclassified aspects of our work in scientific conferences and journals. Many of the unclassified systems we have built have been released to the open source software development community (e.g., SELinux, SEAndroid, Accumulo). Our researchers also interact with the community at large by serving as adjunct faculty members at local universities, and participating in K-12 STEM outreach activities across the country. Unlike many federal research labs, the NSA Research Directorate is funded internally, which allows our researchers to spend their time conducting research rather than writing proposals.
The Research Directorate of the National Security Agency is interested in applicants conducting research in systems (operating systems, compilers, databases, distributed computing, networking), machine learning, data science, human-machine teaming, cybersecurity, computer vision, and computational linguistics. Successful candidates for Research Scientist positions should have demonstrated success in conducting Computer Science research, and depending on the area, demonstrated the ability to turn research ideas into running prototype-grade systems. For Senior Research Scientist positions, applicants must demonstrate a sustained track record of conducting and leading significant research activities.

Have demonstrated a measurable impact based on the models you’ve created. It’s not always easy getting a model correct and we love talking about places we got stuck and working as a team to think through ideas that could unblock us.
Have a desire to ship features powered by data science (in other words, you’re excited by both upfront research and actually getting models into production at cloud scale).
You Have:
Bachelor’s or advanced degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science or other relevant quantitative discipline, or equivalent industry experience.
Have worked in a data science role for 2+ years professionally or academically and can talk about your projects and the techniques you used.

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the Role:
As a Data Scientist, you’ll be involved in all aspects of our analytics, research, model development, and data pipeline. We’re a small but growing company and each team member contributes in a meaningful way. We interview millions of voters through our platform - a novel dataset with tremendous utility for political campaigns. On any given day, you might be building a model to find swing voters, or cleaning data for our political team’s analysis, or optimizing the way we find survey respondents.

In your first weeks:
Expected skills: best-in-class facility with Python (preferably) and/or R (acceptable) as well as SQL; team-based experience with Github; aptitude for working with datasets up to 1TB; experience building predictive models and applying statistics to industrial problems
Example project: build a data pipeline to make available to our political team’s analysis
What you’ll learn: the technology we’ve developed to help campaigns win
By the end of the year, as campaigns are just gearing up for 2020:
Expected skills: complete familiarity with our codebase and tech stack, so that you can commit production-ready code
Example project: building a model to find voters sympathetic to gun-control legislation
What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the country
In 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an Auto ML process for predicting novel variables
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politics
A successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential. Political experience is not required, but if you don’t have a passion for it you might burn out.

Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.
How to apply:
Please send us a note and link to your LinkedIn profile and/or your resume to jobs@changeresearch.com with the subject line ""[Your Name] - Data Scientist"". No phone calls, please.

All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply, including women, people of color, gays and lesbians, transgender people, veterans and people with disabilities."

Expert in Python and core libraries used by data scientists (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, etc.)
Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large or fast moving data sets
Qualified for one of the the specializations below
Specialization: Machine Learning
Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. Very likely you read Wes’ book. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Modern techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern data: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.

Statistical rigor: You should have a solid foundation of the statistics behind standard statistical design methods such as A/B testing and multivariate testing. For example, you should know how to deal with clustering and should be able to determine the standard errors of different statistics through simulation.
Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.
Specialization: Insurance
Industry experience: You have solid P&C experience and have had a significant role in building either pricing or underwriting models.

You’re excited about tackling technical problems that most wouldn’t dare touch. Working with unstructured and nontraditional data doesn’t scare you. Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting
Hiring and leading a team of best-in-class data scientists
What you should already have
Background in mathematics, statistics, or engineering
Some understanding of credit and/or risk underwriting
Bachelors required; Advanced degree preferred
Strong programming ability, preferably in Python

Location: Palo Alto, CA; remote will be considered
Salary: $90,000-$150,000, commensurate with experience; plus equity; health, dental, and vision insurance; flexible PTO plan and company holidays

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the Role:
As a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing, you’ll be involved in all aspects of our analytics, research, model development, and data pipeline. We’re a small but growing company and each team member contributes in a meaningful way. We interview millions of voters through our platform - a novel dataset with tremendous utility for political campaigns. Your role will be focused on turning unstructured public opinion into empirical conclusions.

In your first weeks:
Expected skills: best-in-class facility with Python (preferably) and/or R (acceptable) as well as SQL; team-based experience with Github; experience applying Natural Language Processing models in an industrial setting.
Example project: classifying topics within a sample of open-ended survey responses
What you’ll learn: the technology we’ve developed to help campaigns win
By the end of the year, as campaigns are just gearing up for 2020:
Expected skills: complete familiarity with our codebase and tech stack, so that you can commit production-ready code
Example project: create automatic features from open-ended text to be used in other models
What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the country
In 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an ensemble of models that can process a broad range of answers to open-ended questions like “What do you think of your Congresswoman?” or “What is the biggest issue unaddressed by your local government”?
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politics
A successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential. Political experience is not required, but if you don’t have a passion for it you might burn out.

Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.
How to apply:
Please send us a note and link to your LinkedIn profile and/or your resume to jobs@changeresearch.com with the subject line ""[Your Name] - Data Scientist - NLP"". No phone calls, please.

All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply, including women, people of color, gays and lesbians, transgender people, veterans and people with disabilities."

Experience using Jupyter notebooks
Experience working with large or fast moving data sets
Qualified for one of the the specializations below
Specialization: Machine Learning
Scikit-learn expert: This means you have rolled your own transformers and estimators, which you chained together in a pipeline and found optimal hyperparameters via a randomized grid search (or some other method).
Pandas and Numpy expert: You have used pandas enough to run into its rough parts. Very likely you read Wes’ book. You are fluent with Numpy and array oriented programming in general.
Modern techniques: You are deeply familiar with different validation pitfalls, understand how to effectively ensemble several models, and have experimented with different hyperparameter optimization methods.
Modern data: You have built models using unstructured data such as text or images. You have built time series models using econometric approaches as well as machine learning approaches. Deep algorithmic understanding: You know all the nitty-gritty details of your favorite machine learning algorithms.
Specialization: Marketing
Statistical rigor: You should have a solid foundation of the statistics behind standard statistical design methods such as A/B testing and multivariate testing. For example, you should know how to deal with clustering and should be able to determine the standard errors of different statistics through simulation.
Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.
Specialization: Insurance
Industry experience: You have solid P&C experience and have had a significant role in building either pricing or underwriting models.
Insurance algorithms: Regulators love GLMs. You must be an expert in GLMs.
Modern tools: Maybe you used SAS in the past, but know you should be comfortable building models with Python.

Responses to supplemental questions will be scored using position-specific criteria. Please provide specific and detailed responses of a reasonable length to allow for thorough assessment of your qualifications. Responses which state ""See Resume"" or ""See Application"" may be considered insufficient and therefore may not be scored.

The selection procedure will consist of the following examination:

Relevance of work history, related experience, and achieved level of education and/or training as described in the application and responses to the supplemental questions.
Candidates demonstrating possession of the minimum qualifications will be placed on an employment list in order of most qualified to least qualified based on the achieved score received in the Application & Supplemental Questionnaire Appraisal Examination. Scores may be adjusted based on such factors as number of candidates, anticipated vacancies, past practice, and natural breaks in the scores achieved by this group of candidates.
