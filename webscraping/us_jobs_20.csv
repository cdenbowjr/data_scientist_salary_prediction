A preeminent teaching museum, the museum’s internationally acclaimed collection includes more than 45,000 objects representing nearly every art-producing culture throughout history.

A major highlight of the museum’s wide-ranging collection are its collections of approximately 4,400 works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas (North and Central America, the Caribbean, and Latin America). Thanks in large part to the late Chicago-based collectors Raymond and Laura Wielgus, the Eskenazi Museum possesses one of the most significant collections in this area of any American university art museum. IU is also home to Mathers Museum of World Cultures, which houses a collection of related objects; a nationally recognized, leading African Studies Program; and a Foreign Language Studies Program that teaches more languages than any other school in America. These resources complement the museum’s rich collection of arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.

The Eskenazi Museum of Art is nearing completion of a $30 million renovation of its acclaimed I. M. Pei–designed building. The newly renovated museum will be an enhanced teaching resource for IU and southern Indiana. Positioning the institution as a premier teaching museum requires breakthrough research and programming that advance its mission in powerful ways. To this end, the museum seeks a thoughtful, outgoing, and passionate individual who will serve as the Wielgus Curator of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.

We seek a candidate with an expertise in the arts of Africa, but who is also capable of overseeing our collections of the arts of Oceania and the Americas. The candidate must be a scholar of the highest order who is both capable of conducting their own research on the collection and possesses the ambition and skills to create and manage a robust research program to study, teach, exhibit, and publish the museum’s renowned collections. The individual must work closely with faculty and students in the department of art history and must be skilled at establishing productive relationships with related schools and departments, including the African Studies Program in IU’s Hamilton-Lugar School of Global and International Studies and the Mathers Museum of World Cultures.

About Go

We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).

All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.

We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.

Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.
