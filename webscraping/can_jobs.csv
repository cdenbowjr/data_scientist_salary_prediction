Job Summary


Learning analytics refers to ""the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which learning occurs"" (Society for Learning Analytics, http://www.solaresearch.org)
In the Faculty of Arts, a number of learning analytics projects are underway to allow deans, heads, administrators and faculty members to make use of existing data about students, learning and teaching to better understand 'what is happening' in our courses and programs. The goal, always, is to use available data to answer questions that can support decision-making.
The individual in this role will be responsible for working with a multitude of stakeholders for planning and implementing data projects to explore, analyze and interpret data sets relevant to teaching and learning (including but not limited to: clickstream and engagement data from LMSs and other learning technologies; MOOC data; learner demographics, enrollment and admission records and performance data; course and project evaluation data; survey data.)
The incumbent will stay abreast of current developments in learning analytics, data analytics and institutional analysis and contribute to strategic planning in this area in the Faculty of Arts and the University.

Dynamic Solutions is a software design and development team that brings our clients’ ideas to life.

We're web geeks. We're data geeks.

We share a passion for getting machines working for our clients instead of the other way around.

We believe well designed software works better, is more usable and is more cost effective. We have decades of experience in web and data technologies. We love to apply our proven processes and practices to our clients’ most technical challenges.

We are looking for a great Data Analyst and Data Warehouse Developer to join our team.

You must have at least three years experience as a Data Warehouse developer with the following experience:

data modelling and database design

query design, and optimization

data quality assessment

data extraction and ETL processes

designing and building data-based reports and visualizations

familiarity with dimensional models, and conformed dimensions

are a developer who understands data and databases,

are interested in using modern web technologies to share and present data,

want to work in an environment where the data products you create are used by decision makers,

You will be designing, coding, and testing major features in web applications that provide reports and data visualizations in collaboration with other developers, quality assurance team members and clients.

We are a remote-first company. That means you will be primarily working independently and remotely in your own office. Your office needs to be a secure working environment that allows you to do your best work. We do occasionally work on-site but primarily we work separately. If you haven't worked remote before we recommend you not underestimate the impact. Remote work can be very rewarding and it also has its challenges. It is not for everyone. We have a number of practices such as daily ""standup"" meetings and occasional get togethers and we constantly stay in touch electronically, but for those who are used to working in an office environment the difference can be difficult and may feel isolating. You also need to be entirely self motivated as there won't be anyone checking to make sure you're working.

Dynamic Solutions is continually improving our processes, technologies and tools so that we improve as company and can provide the very best value for our clients and customers. This job provides a lot of opportunities for growing your capabilities.

Because we know you are smart, we will look for you to provide recommendations for improving our technology and development processes. You are the kind of person who stays current with trends and technology ""just because"". You are open to feedback and unreasonably committed to continuously getting better. As part of our team, you will actively participate in agile activities including stand-ups, backlog refinement and sprint planning sessions.

Effective communication is important and you have excellent verbal and written communication skills, enabling you to communicate both technically and non-technically to other team members and clients. You have a positive attitude and willingness to contribute to the ongoing performance of the team.

Your Skills:

Enjoy working independently in a remote-first environment

Proficiency with Python

Proficiency with SQL (Oracle and MySQL)

FoxPro proficiency a bonus (some of our work involves transitioning clients from FoxPro)

Proficiency working in Linux OS (Ubuntu) and Windows

Proficiency with Git

Familiar with the Atlassian suite of tools (JIRA, Bitbucket, Bamboo)

Comfortable working on the command line

We are more interested in your experience and your education, in that order. We want to see your recent work and your resume. Tell us your story and send us links to all your things and we will be in touch if we think there might be a fit.

Hours and Salary

40 hours per week (Monday to Friday - 8 hours per day)

You may occasionally be invited or asked to participate in weekend activities such as hackathons or conferences

3 month trial followed by review for permanent position

Work benefits include working remotely, flexible medical and dental coverage, flexible work schedule and personal development allowances. Full time salary starts at $75,000 and goes up depending on experience. If you’re worth more, prove it to us.

You must live in the General Victoria, BC area and be prepared to work on-site in Victoria as required. We require you to be a Canadian citizen or resident. You also must pass a criminal records check."
