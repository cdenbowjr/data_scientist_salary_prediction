Why are we more susceptible to gastrointestinal cancers as we age?
Are there ways to screen for cancer susceptibility BEFORE it develops?
What is the role of the micro-organisms that live in your gut?

To address these questions, the laboratory of Dr. Juanita Merchant investigates how chronic inflammation in the hepatobiliary and luminal GI tracts leads to gastric and colon cancer. Mini-versions of these tissues can be generated from patient biopsies, and become a renewable source to study their response to various triggers, chemotherapy, inflammation, radiation. The laboratory uses a combination of technologies from molecular and cellular biology to whole genome analysis (NextGen Sequencing) of patient DNA to identify gene mutations and signaling pathways that might provide novel targets for therapy and the development of biomarkers to predict cancer susceptibility.

Microbial (16S) gene profiling is used to identify bacterial species and their byproducts, e.g., butyrate that can protect against inflammation and cancer. The position is a collaboration with translational research ongoing in the laboratory of Dr. Rachna Shroff who treats patients with hepatobiliary cancer and Dr. Yana Zavros, Associate Chair for Research in Cellular and Molecular Medicine who is the Director of the UA Organoid Core.

Job Summary
The PRedictive Integrated Structural Materials Science (PRISMS) Center at University of Michigan is seeking a computational materials scientist to be the lead developer of the PRISMS-PF open source framework for phase field modeling and to apply PRISMS-PF to investigate the effects of microstructure in magnesium alloys. Depending on the level of experience, this research faculty position will be at the Research Investigator or Assistant Research Scientist level. These positions offer attractive benefits and competitive salaries commensurate with qualifications.

The PRISMS Center is a Department of Energy Software Innovation Center focused on developing and demonstrating an open-source Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) framework.

WHO WE ARE:
REEF Technology is the ecosystem that connects the world to your block. Each REEF hub is a thriving, connected ecosystem of businesses, cities and people, that enables and provides the delivery of products and services to more people than ever before. Each location offers a variety of services including micro-fulfillment centers, bike and scooter rental stations, electric vehicle charging, rideshare and autonomous vehicle buffering areas, community spaces for pop-up businesses, and more.

REEF Technology has reimagined the role of a parking facility. We are the largest network of parking lots in North America, believing these locations can do a lot more than just store your car. They serve as buffers for high density, high activity areas and, as such, alleviate congestion and the ensuing pollution. But, with the explosive growth of the sharing and on-demand economy, it is expected that the need for parking to solely store cars will be outgrown by other needs.
We are part of SoftBank, and its portfolio of leading companies transforming business and commerce at the cutting edge of technology in the world today.

With REEF KITCHENS, we enable restaurants to reach more people in the most attractive neighborhoods in hundreds of new cities – without additional capital – by providing turnkey solutions for food preparation and delivery staging and fulfillment.

Our REEF KITCHENS allow for on-site food preparation and our centralized locations serve as an optimal base for food delivery services, so your customers get their meals exactly as you intend them to-fast and fresh.

Who are you?

We are looking for a very motivated Data Analyst that interprets data and turns it into information which can offer ways to improve a business, thus affecting business decisions. Data Analysts gather information from various sources and interpret patterns and trends.

What will you do?
 Collecting, Managing and interpreting data

 Processing confidential data and information according to guidelines.
 Helping develop reports and analysis.
 Managing and designing the reporting environment, including data sources, security, and metadata.
 Supporting the data in identifying and revising reporting requirements.
 Supporting initiatives for data integrity and normalization.
 Generating reports from single or multiple systems.
 Troubleshooting the reporting database environment and reports.
 Training end users on new reports and dashboards.
 Providing technical expertise on data storage structures, data mining, and data cleansing.
 Working alongside teams within the business or the management team to establish business needs


Now let’s talk qualifications, skills & experience. We’d love to hear from you if you have:

 Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Management or Statistics or equivalent combination of education and experience
 Proven working experience as a data analyst or business data analyst
 Expertise regarding data models, database design development, data mining and segmentation techniques

Model and frame business scenarios that are meaningful and which impact on critical business processes and/or decisions.Work in iterative processes with the business and validate findings. For example, validate discovered correlations across data with the business. Discovered findings can appear counter intuitive. Data scientists need to be able to expose the rationale to their findings in easy to understand terms for the business. Data scientists should be prepared to present back results that contradict common belief.Include experimental design approaches to validate findings. Data scientists will need to validate analysis by comparing appropriate samples. In the case of clickstream analysis, it is easy to measure the impact of suggestions on total sales by splitting the users into two populations, one with and one without the recommendation engine. However, similar approaches to validation need to be identified regardless of the use case.Work with IT to support data collection, integration and retention requirements based on the input collected with the business. Examples here may include activities such as the definition of the blog collection process, definition and selection of the proper data infrastructure to perform the analysis, definition of the ""perishability"" of the data and the data archiving technology used to support the life cycle management of the data. The combination of the tools selected is likely to be very dependent on the use case and the assessment done along the 12 dimensions of big data/extreme information.Educate the organization both from IT and the business perspectives on these new approaches, such as testing hypotheses and statistical validation of results. Given how new these approaches may seem too many people, it may come across as esoteric. Helping organizations understand the principles and the math behind it will be essential to driving organizational buy-in.SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES: · Elicit requirements using interviews, document analysis, requirements workshops, surveys, site visits, business process descriptions, use cases, scenarios, business analysis, and task and workflow analysis.· Working with and alongside business analysts. This can be business requirements, such as reducing churn for mobile providers for example, or increasing cross-sell of products by suggesting other products of interest to the client. Identify what data is available and relevant, including internal and external data sources, leveraging new data collection processes such as smart meters and geo-location information or social media.· Proactively communicate and collaborate with external and internal customers to analyze information needs and functional requirements and deliver the following artifacts as needed: (Functional Requirements (Business Requirements Document), iii. Use Cases, GUI, Screen and Interface designs) Assessing whether data is fit for use by performing initial validation of data delivered as part of the project.· Include experimental design approaches to validate findings. Data scientists will need to validate analysis by comparing appropriate samples. Work with IT to support data collection, integration and retention requirements based on the input collected with the business.· Successfully engage in multiple initiatives simultaneously.· Participate and lead in training opportunities as well as conduct self-lead training over relevant topics.· Suggest ongoing improvements to methods and algorithms that lead to findings, including new information. For example, refining suggestions based on clients’ interests, geographic location, age or gender, rather than just based on overall buying pattern.
